Introduction to Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science Specialization
  	##About:
			Discrete Math is needed to see mathematical structures in the object you work with,
			and understand their properties. This ability is important for software engineers, 
			data scientists, security and financial analysts (it is not a coincidence that math
			puzzles are often used for interviews). We cover the basic notions and results (combinatorics,
			graphs, probability, number theory) that are universally needed. To deliver techniques and ideas 
			in discrete mathematics to the learner we extensively use interactive puzzles specially created
			for this specialization. To bring the learners experience closer to IT-applications we incorporate
			programming examples, problems and projects in our courses.
